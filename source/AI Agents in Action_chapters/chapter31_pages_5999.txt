The Manning Early Access Program
Don’t wait to start learning! In MEAP, the Manning Early Access Program, you can read
books as they’re being created and long before they’re available in stores.
Here’s how MEAP works.
•	 Start now. Buy a MEAP and you’ll get all available chapters in PDF, ePub, Kindle,
and liveBook formats.
•	 Regular updates. New chapters are released as soon as they’re written. We’ll
let you know when fresh content is available.
•	 Finish faster. MEAP customers are the first to get final versions of all books!
Pre-order the print book, and it’ll ship as soon as it’s off the press.
•	 Contribute to the process. The feedback you share with authors makes the end
product better.
•	 No risk. You get a full refund or exchange if we ever have to cancel a MEAP.
Explore dozens of titles in MEAP at www.manning.com.

A new online reading experience
liveBook, our online reading platform, adds a new dimension to your Manning books,
with features that make reading, learning, and sharing easier than ever. A liveBook
version of your book is included FREE with every Manning book.
This next generation book platform is more than an online reader. It’s packed with
unique features to upgrade and enhance your learning experience.
• Add your own notes and bookmarks
• One-click code copy
• Learn from other readers in the discussion forum
• Audio recordings and interactive exercises
• Read all your purchased Manning content in any browser, anytime, anywhere
As an added bonus, you can search every Manning book and video in liveBook—even
ones you don’t yet own. Open any liveBook, and you’ll be able to browse the content and
read anything you like.*

*Open reading is limited to 10 minutes per book daily

The difference between iterative and planned execution
Single prompt as a goal:
search Wikipedia for topic, return
the top page, and save to a ﬁle.
Sequential execution of a goal
Single prompt as a goal:
search Wikipedia for topic, return
the top page, and save to a ﬁle.
Iterative execution of a goal
Tasks/plan
Returns a list of page IDs
search_wikipedia(topic)
Returns the page content
get_wikipedia_page(page_id)
Collects pages
save_ ﬁle
All pages combined
In a planner, this
aggregation is
performed
internally.
All tasks are
performed
internally by
the agent.
User submits a goal.
search_wikipedia(topic)
Results are displayed, and the
agent asks to continue to the
next step.
Returns a list of page IDs
get_wikipedia_page(page_id)
User responds
with continue.
Returns are collected and
displayed to the user. The agent
asks for further continuation.
Returns the page content
save_ ﬁle
All pages combined
User responds
with continue.
Goal is complete, and user has the output.
Iterative
execution
is default
behavior
for an LLM.
Sequential
(planned)
execution is
standard in

ost production AI systems require many orchestrated
interactions between the user, AI models, and a wide
variety of data sources. AI agents capture and organize
these interactions into autonomous components that can pro-
cess information, make decisions, and learn from interactions
behind the scenes. Th is book will show you how to create AI
agents and connect them together into powerful multi-agent
systems.
In AI Agents in Action, you’ll learn how to build production
-ready assistants, multi-agent systems, and behavioral agents.
You’ll master the essential parts of an agent, including
retrieval-augmented knowledge and memory, while you create
multi-agent applications that can use software tools, plan tasks
autonomously, and learn from experience. As you explore the
many interesting examples, you’ll work with state-of-the-art
tools like OpenAI Assistants API, GPT Nexus, LangChain,
Prompt Flow, AutoGen, and CrewAI.
What’s Inside
